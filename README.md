# SEE---The-Third-Eye

According to WHO, 39 million peoples are estimated as blind worldwide. They are suffering immense hardships in their daily life.

The affected ones have been using the traditional white cane for many years which although being effective, still has a lot of disadvantages. Another way is, having a pet animal such as a dog, but it is really expensive.

So, the aim of the project ,"Third Eye", is to develop a cheap and more efficient way to help visually impaired to navigate with greater comfort, speed and confidence.

SEE is a Python based system including hardware using Arduino, Raspberry Pi and required sensors and motors; runs on Image Processing and Text-To-Speech API. 
A smart solution with Smart Cap, Smart Gloves and Smart Body Module to help the blind navigate the roads safely and confidently. The Smart Cap consists of a camera which reads traffic signs and guides the user accordingly by instructing them through speech. The Smart Gloves and Smart Body Module have sensors attached which vibrate the vibration motor alerting the user. 

SMART CAP
Smart Cap helps the user navigate through traffic safely and confidently by reading out traffic signboards to them and instructs them accordingly, which is recorded in real-time by the camera fixed on the cap.
This module uses:
- OpenCV for image processing.
- Raspberry Pi
- Text-to-Speech Google api
- Libraries like imutils, numpy
- Pi Cam
 
SMART GLOVES
Smart Gloves facilitate the user to detect obstacles in their proximity and alert them by vibrating. The Ultrasonic sensors keep a constant watch for the user to walk around safely.
This module uses:
- Arduino UNO and Arduino MEGA
- Servo Motors
- Ultrasonic Sensors
- Jumper Wires

SMART BODY MODULE
The Smart Body Module consists of 4 modules that the user fixes at the designated area, i.e. , 
- 2 on the shoulders (to detect obstacles for the upper body)
- 2 on the knees (to detect obstacles for the lower body)
This ensures complete protection from obstacles for the user.
This module uses:
- Arduino MEGA
- Ultrasonic Sensors
- Servo Motors
- Jumper wires
- Module holder
- Breadboard
